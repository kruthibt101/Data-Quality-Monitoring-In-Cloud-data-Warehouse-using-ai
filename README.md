# Data-Quality-Monitoring-In-Cloud-data-Warehouse-using-ai
Automating data quality monitoring in cloud data warehouses using AI 
technologies. Ensuring high data quality is critical for accurate analytics and 
decision-making, yet traditional monitoring methods are often manual, timeconsuming, and prone to errors. The proposed solution leverages artificial 
intelligence to automate the detection and resolution of data quality issues, such as 
missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.This project aims to develop an automated data quality monitoring system leveraging 
AI within a cloud data warehouse. The system will proactively identify and address 
data quality issues, ensuring data accuracy, completeness, and consistency for 
improved decision-making and business intelligence.
